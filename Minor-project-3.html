					  <h1>Why Should I Consider a Government Job?</h1>
					  <p font size=4>In India, a Sarkari Naukri (or an Indian government job) is highly sought-after. It's the ultimate career goal, offering long-term security, good benefits, and friendly co-workers.</p><br>
					  <p>More than that, an Indian government job offers an opportunity to live a life of purpose.</p><br>

					  <p>According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. (CMIE), the unemployment rate in India increased from 6.5% in November 2020 to 7.75% in October 2021. In this fluctuating market, there has been an increase in the demand for the stability and permanence offered by a Sarkari Naukri.</p><br>
					  <p>In addition, government jobs in India can be pretty lucrative offering competitive salaries, benefits, and pensions. Some of the highest-paid jobs in the Indian government include the Indian Administrative Services (IAS), Indian Foreign Services (IFS), and Indian Police Services (IPS).</p><br>
					  <p>Keep in mind that these jobs are also highly competitive with a complex application process!</p><br>

							<h1>What Kind of Government Jobs Can I Get?</h1>
						<p font size=4>There are a wide variety of government jobs in India. It depends on your interests, but a job in the Indian government can range from policy-making, public administration, military, law, engineering, and even teaching. Some of the more highly-paid and in-demand positions are discussed below to give you a sense of their requirements and salary expectations.</p><br>

<p>1. Indian Administrative Services (IAS) and Indian Foreign Services (IFS) Jobs : The role of an IAS officer may include advising the ministers on various policy issues, implementing policies of the government, collecting revenue, and supervising public spending. An IFS officer manages foreign relations in India with more than 160 Indian Diplomatic Missions and International Organizations around the world. The starting monthly salary of an IAS or IFS officer is about INR 56,100.</p><br>

<p>2. Indian Police Services (IPS) Jobs : A role with the IPS involves safeguarding the public, maintaining law and order, and detecting and preventing crime. The role can be with the various agencies and branches including the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Criminal Investigation Department (CID). To be eligible for a job with IPS, there are additional requirements, including physical standards. Physical eligibility includes minimum height for men and women, minimum chest girth for men and women, restriction on vision impairments including myopia limited to less than -4.00, and hyper myopia not exceeding +4.00. According to Payscale, an entry-level police constable with less than 1-year experience can earn an average total compensation of INR 255,094. This includes tips, bonuses, and overtime pay.</p><br>

<p>3. Banking Jobs :The banking sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in India. It's not surprising that jobs in government-approved banks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), Allahabad Bank, HDFC, and ICICI are highly sought after. A job in the banking sector could either be a clerical position such as typists, data entry operators, cashiers, or clerks or a probationary officer (PO) role. As a PO, the candidate will be under probation during the training period and will be hired following the probation based on performance. During the training period, the candidate will be trained in accounting, finance, billing, investment, and revenue collection. A PO role allows opportunities for career growth to middle and senior management based on performance and additional examinations. The starting monthly salary of a PO is about INR 57,000 including allowances.</p><br>

<p>4. Defence Jobs : Jobs with the National Defence Academy (NDA) can be in various departments, such as Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, etc. A job in the NDA comes with strict restrictions on age, physical, and vision standards. Cadet trainees receive a stipend of INR 56,100 per month. Allowances and promotions will increase this salary. There are also several agricultural, engineering, and research jobs with their own set of rules and requirements. These can get very complicated, but Sarkari Result does all the work for you and lists the various jobs ranging from a Rajasthani police constable to Allahabad High Court Review Officer. Each job posting contains all the details you would need to be able to apply for the position with ease.</p><br>

<h1>How Competitive Is the Government Job Market?</h1>
<p>There is no doubt that finding an Indian government job is highly competitive. The Times of India said it best when they said that the numbers are staggering:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.3 million applications for 368 peon positions in Uttar Pradesh.</li>
<li>2.5 million applications for 6,000 positions in Bengal	</li>
<li>200,000 applications for 1,137 positions as police constables in Maharashtra.</li></ul>
<p>When the Ministry of Railways started recruiting for around 63,000 positions, they received more than 19 million (1.9 crores) job applications.</p>
<p>With COVID-19, the competition has only increased because of the drop in the number of people hired by the government. The central government hired 119,000 people in 2021 which is a reduction in almost 32,000 jobs. There was a similar drop in 2021 of almost 107,000 people hired by the state government. This creates an extremely competitive environment. Getting up-to-date information on the latest jobs on Sarkari Result and understanding eligibility requirements can help you stand out from the crowd. These are of course some of the most coveted roles in India and are extremely competitive.</p>
